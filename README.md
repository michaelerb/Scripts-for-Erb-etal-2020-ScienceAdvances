# README: Scripts for Erb et al. 2020, Science Advances

This directory contains the Python 3 scripts I used to produce the figures in Erb et al. 2020, "Atmospheric Dynamics Drive Most Interannual U.S. Droughts over the Last Millennium".

I have not generalized these scripts to work out-of-the-box on other machines, so the code references my own directories and files, which you won't have on your own computer.  So you'll have to update the scripts before they run.  Some of these scripts use files or code which isn't available elsewhere; if you encounter this, please contact me and I'll try to help.  Additionally, if you see errors in the code, please let me know.  My contact information is: Michael Erb, michael.erb@nau.edu.

Filenames indicate the figures that each script produces, with 1-6 for the paper's main figures and S1-S11 for the paper's supplementary figures.  For example, "2_S4_atlases_vs_lmr_scpdsi.py" produces Fig. 2 and Fig. S4.  Some scripts also produce additional figures.  The comments at the top of each file should provide some description of the file, but I can't gaurentee that this description (or the "date" field, which I sometimes forget to update) is completely up-to-date.  Rather, I'm releasing this code as-is, in the interest of a more transparent scientific process.

Feel free to use any of this code as you see fit, but please double-check that it is accurate and suitable for your purposes.  This code is offered as-is, with no gaurentees of any kind.
